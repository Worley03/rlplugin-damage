# Damage Sounds
A simple plugin that plays custom sounds when the player takes damage at the desired amount.

In order to play custom sounds, place a .WAV file inside of .runelite/damagesounds/

EXAMPLE FORMAT: customsound1.wav:10,customsound2.wav:20,customsound3.wav:30
(YOU MUST INCLUDE THE .WAV FILE EXTENSION)

The above example will play customsound1 when the player takes 10-19 damage, customsound2 when the player takes 20-29 damage, and customsound3 when the player takes 30+ damage.

Sound files MUST be a .WAV file.

littledamage.wav and bigdamage.wav are include custom sounds made by my son.
