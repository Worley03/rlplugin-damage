# Damage Sounds
A simple plugin that plays custom sounds when the player takes damage at the desired amount. 

In order to play custom sounds, place a .WAV file inside of .runelite/damagesounds/

EXAMPLE FORMAT: soundfile1.wav:10,soundfile2.wav:20,soundfile3.wav:30
(YOU MUST INCLUDE THE .WAV FILE EXTENSION)

The above example will play soundfile1 when the player takes 10-19 damage, soundfile2 when the player takes 20-29 damage, and soundfile 3 when the player takes 30+ damage.

Sound files MUST be a .WAV file.
